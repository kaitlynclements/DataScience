Description: Using Pandas and Altair to analyze and visualize a marathon dataset. 
Inputs: marathon_small.csv
"""

# Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

"""
Step 1: Load and Explore the Data
"""
# Read dataset into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv("data/marathon_small.csv")

# Print top 25 rows to get overview of data
print("Top 25 rows of dataset:")
print(data.head(25))

# Print shape of dataset (number of rows & columns)
print("\nDataset shape (rows, columns): ", data.shape)

"""
Step 2: Subset and Filter Data
"""
# Filter only male runners from dataset
males = data[data["sex"] == "male"]

# New dataframe with only the columns 'bmi' and 'km10_time_seconds'
males = males[["bmi", "km10_time_seconds"]]

# Remove rows where km10_time_seconds is missing
males = males.dropna(subset=["km10_time_seconds"])

"""
Step 3: Transform Data
"""
# Convert 10 km race time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60
# Store results in new column, 'km10_time_minutes'
males["km10_time_minutes"] = males["km10_time_seconds"] / 60

"""
Step 4: Visualize the Relationship
"""
# Create Scatter plot using Altair. X-axis: bmi, Y-axis: kn10_time_minutes

Step 5: Interpret the Results

    <h1>Step 5: Interpret the Results</h1>
    <h2>Based on your visualization, answer the following question: What relationship do you observe between BMI and 10km race time?</h2>
    <h3>Answer: B - Positive correlation (Higher BMI â†’ Longer race time)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data visualization shows that as BMI increases, race time also increases for male runners. 
    This could be due to the fact that a higher body mass contributes to longer race completion times due to factors such as endurance and energy expenditure.</p>
