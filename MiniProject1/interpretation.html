    <h1>Step 5: Interpret the Results</h1>
    <h2>Based on your visualization, answer the following question: What relationship do you observe between BMI and 10km race time?</h2>
    <h3>Answer: B - Positive correlation (Higher BMI â†’ Longer race time)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data visualization shows that as BMI increases, race time also increases for male runners. 
    This could be due to the fact that a higher body mass contributes to longer race completion times due to factors such as endurance and energy expenditure.</p>
